#Write a program to find wether the given number is positive, negative or zero
#Write a program to find wether our bussiness is making profit, loss or breeakeven

# expenses = 1100

#Objective 2: Say wether we are making profit or not
# if (sales > expenses):
#     #block of code:
#     print("You are making profit :)")
# else:
#     print("You are making Losses")

#Objective 3: Say wether we are making profit or loss or breakeven (3 conditions)
# if (sales > expenses):
#     #block of code:
#     print("You are making profit :)")
# elif (sales == expenses):
#     print("You're making Breakeven")
# else:
#     print("You are making Losses")

#find wether the given number is even or odd

#if the stament to be xqted is not a block of code, it's a sggle statment can be wrie in a single line
if (givennumber % 2== 0): print("Even Number")

#find wheter the given numb is even or odd:
print ("Even Number") if (givennumber % 2 == 0) else print("Odd Number") 
#this only applied when there is only ONE CONDITION, if not use block of code

# find the givennumber is positive or negative or zero:
print("+ve") if (givennumber > 0) else print("-ve") if (givennumber < 0) else print("zero")
